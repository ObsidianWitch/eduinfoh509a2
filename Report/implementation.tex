\section{Implementation}

For each person (author or editor) found in the dblp excerpt, we had to generate
an HTML file with the following path:
\hl{a-tree/first-letter-of-lastname/lastname.firstname.html}.\\

First of all, we have to retrieve each distinct author and editor (there are
multiple publications, so an author/editor can appear multiple times). In order
to do so, the \hl{xsl:for-each-group} element was used, which lets us group
elements and iterate over them. Here, we selected authors and editors, and
grouped them by themselves.\\

\begin{lstlisting}
<xsl:template match="/">
    <xsl:for-each-group select="/dblp/*/author | /dblp/*/editor" group-by=".">
    ...
    </xsl:for-each-group>
</xsl:template>
\end{lstlisting}
\

Then, for each author (or editor), we want to be able to create a file with the
correct name. To do that, we created the \hl{ufn:format\_full\_name()} function
which takes as parameter the full name of a person. The lastname is extracted
and put in the first position. Then, if the first name has multiple parts, they
are concatenated with '\_', and if '.' is present, it is then removed (e.g.
\emph{A. B. M. Shawkat Ali} becomes \emph{Ali.A\_B\_M\_Shawkat}).\\

Once the name is correctly formatted, we can use \hl{xsl:result-document} to
produce a document per author/editor.\\

\begin{lstlisting}
<xsl:result-document href="a-tree/{$first_letter}/{$formattedAuthor}.html">
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Publication of <xsl:value-of select="$author"/></title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <xsl:call-template name="author_header"/>
            <xsl:call-template name="author_publication"/>
            <xsl:call-template name="coauthor_index"/>
        </body>
    </html>
</xsl:result-document>
\end{lstlisting}
